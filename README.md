### Overview
I create a simple chat app with Flutter for Android and Web Platforms, the app itself used [Appwrite Flutter SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/appwrite) to help me build the app, and with default state management from Flutter itself.
The app also uses some other packages like Go Router ( because I want to deploy it into a web app ) and Secure Storage ( it helps me with auth ).
The inspiration behind the idea is I'm working on several projects ( small projects ) that require feature chat, and I know Appwrite has a real-time database on it, then I give it a try to test it out. ( FYI: it was amazing :) )
